\title{A tibble leaderboard for \code{caret} \code{train} objects}
\usage{
board(model = NULL, path = here::here("models"), dir = "initial",
  save = TRUE, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{model to add to the leaderboard. If no model is supplied
(the default \code{null}), \code{board} returns the leaderboard tibble
for the project.}

\item{path}{globally sets the path to save models and leaderboards. By
default, the path is the project directory found by. For best results, the path
string should be constructed with \code{file.path} or
\href{https://github.com/krlmlr/here}{\code{here::here()}}.}

\item{dir}{globally sets name of directory where models are saved.
This will be a subdirectory of the specified path. The default directory
is named \code{models_one}. If no argument is supplied, the model will be saved
in the previously specified directory. See the example below.}

\item{save}{whether \code{board} should save the supplied model to \code{dir}. If
\code{FALSE} the model will not be saved, but will be added to the leaderboard.}

\item{quiet}{whether \code{board} should return the leaderboard tibble to the console.
By default \code{quiet = FALSE} means that the tibble prints to console.
\code{quiet = TRUE} is useful in a \code{.Rmd} environment, where you want to add
the model to the leaderboard without printing the tibble.}
}
\value{
\code{tibble} containing the most up-to-date leaderboard.
}
\description{
This function updates and returns
the model leaderboard for the project. Please read the

\examples{
# add caret model to leaderboard
# model saved to "models_one"
model <- train(...)
leadr::board(model)

# return tibble leaderboard
leadr::board()

# save to different directory
ensemble <- train(...)
leadr::board(ensemble, dir = "ensembles_one")

# board automatically saves to previous directory
# model saved to "ensembles_one"
